# Articles - Community Edition

Edit the [./articles.json](./articles.json) file appending the entries that you find interesting and hope to share with the community.

When your PR gets accepted, your content will be loaded by any PGMate clients running out there.

## Basic Rules

- learning resources are great
- promoting commercial tools is bad
- interesting discussion about Postgres are good
- personal stuff, political stuff, stuff like that is really bad
- stuff that has nothing to do with Postgres is bad
